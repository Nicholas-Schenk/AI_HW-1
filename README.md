Generate.py should solve part 0.

Currently generate.py has a main method that I was using for testing it. Obviously, though, in the actual code we will be importing the file and using the function generate, so we will need to get rid it then. 

Update 10/4
created runner.py and astar.py. Both are uninfinished in terms of implmentaiton. runner.py only supports displaying generated grids
